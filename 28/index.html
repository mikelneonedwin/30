                    <p class="opacity-80">I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who have an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibily fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

                    <p>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>

                <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
                <p>Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers 100% recommended!</p>
